        <h1>CSMM.101x—Quiz 2 Graph</h1>
        <p>This page was created to help students of the CSMM.101x course on edX who are struggling to answer the questions related to the graph in Quiz 2. It is true one should know how the algorithms work, but I do not think students should be graded by their ability to execute an algorithm by hand. We have machines for that.</p>
        <p>You can use this data to create a program that will help you in answering the questions. In addition, if you scroll to the bottom, you will also find clearer version of the graph (no more confusion between 66 and 99 or anything). You can also download the data as a text file from <a href='graph.txt' download>here</a>.</p>
        <p>If you find any issues, please raise an issue <a href='https://github.com/Owlree/csmm.101x-graph/issues'>on GitHub</a>.</p>
        <h2>Data format</h2>
        <p>On the first line you have <i>n</i> the total number of numbers. The following <i>n</i> lines begin with an integer ID, which and continue with the city name for that ID (e.g. Las Vegas has ID 6). After those <i>n</i> lines, there is <i>m</i>, the number of edges, followed by <i>m</i> lines, each one representing an edge denoted by three integers. The first two integers are the IDs of the cities linked by the edge, and the third is its length.</p>
